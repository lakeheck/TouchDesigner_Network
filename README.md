# TouchDesigner_Network

Repo holding TouchDesigner components used in my practice. Originally forked from David Braun's execellent repository (https://github.com/DBraun/TouchDesigner_Shared). 

Simulations folder contains GPU-based simulations of natural processes (such as fluid dyanmics, flocking, etc) along with .tox files and example .toe projects. 

Utilites folder contains general utilities used in a variety of contexts, as well as my custom interface components build for my personal workflow. 

Other folders contain .tox files resulting in their respective operator types. 

I hope that these may help others along their way - feel free to contact me with questions, bugs, or any other type of feedback!
