# TouchDesigner_Network

Repo holding TouchDesigner components used in my practice. Originally forked from David Braun's excellent repository (https://github.com/DBraun/TouchDesigner_Shared). 

Simulations folder contains GPU-based simulations of natural processes (such as fluid dyanmics, flocking, etc) along with .tox files and example .toe projects. 

A bit outdated now, but I hope helpful to those who find it.
